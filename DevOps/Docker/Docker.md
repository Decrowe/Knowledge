Docker Engine
Virtualizes Operatingsystem
Container
- OS
- CPU
- Memory
- NEtwork
Containers are isolated

## Why is it so fast?
You only need one Kernel!
All containers depend on the same kernel.
Since this kernel is running all the time the containers do not need to boot it on their own and safe time.

## Limitations
You can only run 
- Linux Containers on Linux machines
- Windows Containers on Windows machines
Because all containers share OS / Kernal

## Usecases
Run code everywhere!
