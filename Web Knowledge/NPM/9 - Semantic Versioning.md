# Versions
Each package has a version. 
All versions (should) follow the [semantic versioning specs](https://semver.org/lang/de/) rules.

___
*Since SemVer is used mostly in Context of NPM many developers do not follow the rules strctly it is gut m√∂glich quite possible that there are breaking changes even if just the patch version increased.*
___

## In Short:
A version consists of 3 numbers:
1) Major
2) Minor
3) Patch

Example: **2.4.3** 
**2**: Major
**4**: Minor
**3**: Patch

## Installing Dependencies according to SemVer
### Caret 
Imagen following **Package.json**
``` json
{
  "name": "npm_learning",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "This package is only for learning purpose.",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "learning"
  ],
  "author": "Lukas Walter",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "lodash": "^4.0.0"
  }
}
```

Inside the dependencies field we have defined lodash as following:
- "lodash": "*^4.0.0*" - notice the: **^**
  - The **^** indicates **NPM** to take the highest possible version beginning with Major Version: *4*
  - It is comparable to *4.x.x* - which would mean: upgrade to the latest **Minor** and **Patch** version compatible with **Major version**: *4* 


### Tidal
Now imagen this **Package.json**:
``` json
{
  "name": "npm_learning",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "This package is only for learning purpose.",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "learning"
  ],
  "author": "Lukas Walter",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "lodash": "~4.0.0"
  }
}
```

We now have replaced the **^** with a tidal **~**.
This is comparable to: *4.0.x*. Meaning that this will use the latest **Patch** version but remains the **Major** and **Minor** version

### Fixed version
You can also set the Version to be fixed by neither using a **caret** not a **tidal**:
``` json
{
  "name": "npm_learning",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "This package is only for learning purpose.",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "learning"
  ],
  "author": "Lukas Walter",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "lodash": "4.0.0"
  }
}
```
This will install the exactly specified version.
